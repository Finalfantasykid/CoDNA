This is a quick and simple classification engine, for populating a database with edit classification data.
It uses the levenshtein program from /tools/levenshtein (levenshtein.c). The PHP script requires a compiled copy of the levenshtein tool in this directory.

Note that this script uses cURL, so make sure to have that enabled in PHP.
